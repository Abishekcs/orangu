//! Where a token is decoded, measured rather than assumed — the decode half
//! of what `engine::prefill_backend` does for prompts.
//!
//! `backend = auto` takes a GPU whenever there is one. That is right on a
//! machine whose GPU out-decodes its cores, and wrong on one with a weak
//! integrated GPU beside fast cores — and until this was measured nothing
//! told the two apart. So under `auto`, once the model is built on the
//! device, it is also built on the CPU backend (a view of the same mapped
//! weights, not a copy) and a few real one-token decode steps are timed on
//! each: the model's own forward pass, at the width a served token takes.
//! The device keeps the model unless the cores are at least
//! [`MIN_GAIN`] faster — at parity the device is the better place, since it
//! leaves the cores to the prompts and to everything else (`doc/PERF-ALL.md`,
//! task 7).
//!
//! `ORANGU_DECODE_PROBE=0` skips the measurement and keeps the device, as
//! before; an explicit `backend` is never second-guessed.
