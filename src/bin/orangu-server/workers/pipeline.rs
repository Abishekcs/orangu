//! One node's slice of a split model: the layers it runs itself, then the
//! [`Stage`]s it hands the rest to, in layer order.
//!
//! The same [`LayerPipeline`] runs at every level of a worker tree. At the
//! top it sits inside a [`DelegatingModel`], between the embedding and the
//! head; on a worker it sits inside a [`super::session::SessionStore`],
//! between the parent's `Forward` and its `ForwardResult`. A stage that is
//! itself a worker with workers of its own is what makes the tree a
//! pyramid, and nothing here needs to know how deep it goes.
