//! The wire protocol between a node and its workers.
//!
//! One persistent connection per parent/child pair carries frames:
//!
//! ```text
//! [len: u32 LE][type: u8][id: u64 LE][payload: len - 9 bytes]
//! ```
//!
//! `id` pairs an answer with its request: a parent has several requests in
//! flight on one connection — one per sequence it is running — and a
//! worker answers each as soon as it is done, in whatever order that is.
//! The handshake, before any of that, uses `0`.
//!
//! Integers are little-endian; a string or byte blob is a `u32` length and
//! its bytes; a list is a `u32` count and its items. A decoder reads the
//! fields it knows and **ignores anything after them**, so a newer peer can
//! append fields to a message without breaking an older one — gated, on the
//! sending side, by the `features` bits the peer advertised in the handshake.
//! An unknown message *type* is an error the receiver answers with
//! [`ErrorCode::Unsupported`].
