//! Spreading one model's layers over a tree of `orangu-server` nodes —
//! the `[workers]` section. See `doc/WORKERS.md` for the design and for
//! what is built so far.
//!
//! - [`protocol`]: the frames a parent and a worker exchange.
//! - [`auth`]: proving `[workers].secret` without sending it.
//! - [`identity`]: making sure every node has the same model, quantization
//!   included.
//! - [`pipeline`]: one node's slice — its own layers, then its workers' —
//!   and the top-level node's [`pipeline::DelegatingModel`].
//! - [`stage`]: the parent side of a forward; [`link`]: its TCP connection.
//! - [`session`]: the worker side of a forward.
//! - [`plan`]: dividing a range of layers by memory.
//! - [`node`]: one process's place in the tree, both halves.
//! - [`clock`]: keeping a node's cores at full clock while a request runs.
//! - [`transport`]: plain TCP or TLS between nodes.
