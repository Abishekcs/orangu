//! What a node's `/metrics` says about its workers: per worker, how long a

//! each way, how often it failed, and whether it is up; per node, how often
//! it planned and how often a sequence was rebuilt after a lost worker.
//!
//! Labelled by the worker's address as `[workers].workers` lists it — a
//! handful of values per node, so the cardinality stays what the config
